Ltus OF Μ. coactus CATO. 165

tara, under Μ’ Α611166 Glabrio, who had been sent 16
oppose the invasion 61 Antiochus, king of Syria. Here,
at the decisivo battle of Thermopylae, Cato exhibited
extraordinary valor and high military genius, and, ¹
after the action, was embraced, at the head of the
army, by the consul, who ascribed to him the whole
credit 61 the victory. We have no trustworthy ac·
counts 61 any later military acts performed by Oat03 .
but his valuable services and characteristic genius were
afterwards seen in the cens'orship which he obtained,
B. 0184, with his friend Valerius. In this office he
showed himself such abitter enemy to the habits of
luxury and the relaxation of the old code 61 Roman
morals, that he met with the most strenuous opposition
of the patriciana, and'was compelled to live in almost
constant warfare against the most influential 61 bis
fellowcitizens. Although a rigid censor of the publio
morals, 116 1166 himself accused,—pr'0bably in most
cases from factious bitterness and political prejudice, -
and compelled to stand trial forty-four times, the last
in the eighty-first year of his life, when 116 uttered
the complaint that “it was hard to be obliged to defend
himself before men of an age different from thatin
which 116 himself had lived.”

After this, the public life 61 0616 was passed chiefly
in the business of the Forum, the senate, and in popu-
lar assemblies. But his infiexible opposition to luxury
still continued. In B. Ο. 181, he favored the adoption ⁵
61 the Lex Orchia, by the provisions of which the nurn-
ber of gnests at banquets wasto be restricted; and in
B. (l. 169, when sixty-five years 61 age, 116 supported
with all his youtlrful rigor the Lex Voconia (v. 14),
which had forits object to prevent the accumulation
61 wealth in the 'hands 61 women. ,,
