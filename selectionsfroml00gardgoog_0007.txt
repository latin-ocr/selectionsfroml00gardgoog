PREFACE.

—000—

ΙΝ presenting to the public the second volume of
the “Latin School Series,” the Editors wish to express
the gratification they have experienced at the recep-
tion of its predecessor.

Το what was said'in the prefaoe of the first volume
it seems necessary to add, simply, that the best edi· '
tions and the best texts of the various authors have
been employed, and that orthography adopted which· ’
receives the sanction of the most eminent classical
scholare os the present day.

It is hoped that the Dictionary which is appended

' willbe found to be a valuable addition to the text, ⁴

as no pains have been spared to select an appropriate

meaning for the words as phey occur in each particular
passage. Especial attention has been given to the
derivationes the words by inserting all that would
be profitable to studente at this period of their classi·
cal studies.
