LAELIUS.

Trrn treatise De Amicitia was written shortly aster
the De Senectute, and, like it, was dedicated to Τ.
Pomponius Atticus. The scene of the dialogue is leid

¹ in the time of the Gracchan revolution, when the differ-
ent political factione were embroiled in discord, civil
strife, and deadly feuds, and when bitter persoual ani-
mosities, arising from the conflict of opinions in regard
to the agrarian law, were severing the ties of friendship
between the different classes of citizens, lund even be·
tween the members of the same household.

The chief speaker iu the dialogueis Caius Laelius
Sapiens, to whom his two sons-inlaw, Q. Mucius Scae·
valeand Ο. Fannius, are represented as making a visit
afew days after the death of Scipio Africanus Minor,

und telling him how anxious everybody is tc know how '

he bears the death of his most intimate friend. This
opens the way for the nequest which they make, that ”
he will give them his views on the subject of Fricnd·
ship, so well exemplified between himself and one,
who, as PaterculussuyS, “never uttered a sentiment,
nor performed an action, that was not worthy of ap·-
plause.’'
