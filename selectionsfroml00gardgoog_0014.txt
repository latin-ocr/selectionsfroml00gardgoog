lished work was the Amores. Thiswas followedby
the Melitamlae Faciet, deser-ibing the various arta of
the toilct then in use,a part only of which is extant,
and hythe Heroides, in which the legendary love sto
ries are reproduccd in the form of Epistles. ,Later ap-
peared, more perfect in form and richer in contents, the
Ara Ameneia, or Amatoria, and about two years afler-
wards the Remedia Ameria. Of dfedee, a tragedy,
which was praised aa a masterpiece, nothing remains.
But more important than all the rest are two works of
a widely different character, the Fasti, a summary of
the religion, history, and civil institutione of Rome, and
the Metamorphoses, in which the poet treats with mas·
terly skill and luxuriant fancy of those transformatione
which formed so large an clement in the ancient my-
thology, and for the materials of which he was mainly ,
indebted to the Greeks.

But the Metamorphoses lacked the finishing toacher,
aad the Fasti was but half completed, when, by a spe·
cial decree of Augustus, about 7 A. D, Ovid was ban-
ished to Tomi,a city of Thrace, on the Black Sea. The
real canae of this misfortune has never been discovered.
Ovid admits an error, and refers to the Are Ama-adt
asan ostensible reason. But whatever it was, no lam-
entatione, no entreaties, could effect a revocation of the
decree. Yet even in banishment-for it was not a
. formal exile, as he lost neither property nor citizenship
-his poetic genius was still active in the productiora
of the Tristia, and the Epistulae ea Poato, and some
minor works; but solitudo, despair, and advancing age
gradually chilled the poet's spirits, and at length death
ended his hardshipa, 17 A. D, three years after the
decease of Augustus
