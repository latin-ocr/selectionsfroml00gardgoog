01 philosophy. Altbough he was chiefly distinguished

as a philosopher, he frequented the Forum, where hc
gained considerable celebrity as anorator. His mili·
tary career, though brief, was emiuently successful.
He accompanied his friend Scipio Aemilianus on his
voyage to Carthage, and proved himself iu that cam-
paign a valiant soldier. He was tribune of the pcople
B. O. 151, praetor B. O. 145, and consul B. 0. 140.

were in favor 01 making the plebeians lauded proprie·

racy. He assisted the consuls, B. Ο. 132, in examin*
ing 0.B10ssics of Curuae (xi. 37), and in Β. C. 130 he
opposed the Papirian Rogation (xxv. 96), which had

history he has been considered as the representative 01·
the Hellenic culture of his century. .

¹His friendship for Scipio never faltered, and Cicero
has immortalized this trait of his character by placing
his name at the head 01 the dialogus De Amicitia.

Sorrio Amoenus Muros was the younger son of
L. Aemilius Paullus, the conqueror 01 Macedonia, but
was adopted by P. Scipio, the son of Africanus Maior,
