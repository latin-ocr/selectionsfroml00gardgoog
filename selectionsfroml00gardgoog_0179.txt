obstinate and nnrelentin'g disposition which he dis·
ι played throughout his long public career. l

Cato was a voluurinous writer, but only porticus oi
his works have corne down to us, and these in a muti
lated condition. His treatise De lte Rustico consiste κ
mainly of a series of dry rules, relating to domestic and ·
rural economy. He composed avast number of orations,

one hundred and fifty of which Cicero says that hs ⁶

had himself read; also a work on military discipline,
and aboolr os letters to his oldest son, containing in-
structions on subjecte connected with the education of
Roman youth. When quite advanced in life, he began
a historical work, osten alluded to in De Senectute,
entitled “ Origines? or seven books illustrating the
history and antiquities of Rome.

Cicero undoubtedly chose the aged Cato aa the chief
speaker in his dialogue out cl' sympathy with his pub· .
lic life, similar literary tastes, and rigid tone of morale
They were both novi homines ,¹ both had gained tha
highest offioes in the state, and each had proved him-
selfa firm friend to the liberties of his country, and an
uncompromisiug enemy to dissolute morale and politi·
cal corruption.

The minor characters in the dialogne,Sc1r10and
Larumna, are introduced with greater prominence in
the treatise De Amicitia. A brief account of their lives
isgiven on pp. aar-232. At the time of this discourse
they are represented as very young men'‚not yet hav·
ing displayed those talents and virtues which gave
them distinction in their subsequent career.
