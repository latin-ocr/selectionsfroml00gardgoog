230 SCIPIO AFRICANUS moa

'the war against Carthago. Accompanied by Laelius
and Polybius, he set sail sor Africa, where military
operatione were resumed with increaaed vigor. Al·
though the Carthaginians held out till the spring oi
the following year, they at length yielded to the supe·⁸
rior valor os their assailants. They defended them-
selves, however, with the courage of despair, and when
the work of destruction was completed, Scipio, antici-

, pating that a similar fate might befall Rome, is said to

have repeated over the ruins of Carthago these lines ,
of Homer (Il. vi. 448) :- '

The day will come when sacred Ilium will perish,
And Priam, and the peoplc ci Priam, of the good arhen specu

On Scipio's return to Rome he wau rewarded
⁸ with a splendid triumph on account olbis victory, and
received the surnamc of Africanus, which he had al-
ready inherited by adoption from the conqueror of
Hannibal.

In B. O. 133 Scipio met with eqnal success in the ¹
war against Numantia, from which he received the eur·
name Numantinus. He was engaged in this last cam·
paign when the disturbances sprang up at Rome in
consequence of the mensures proposed by Tiberius
Gracchus, and ended in the death of this political agi-
tator. Although Scipio had married Sempronia, the
nister of Gracchusue did not adopt his political views,
and showed no sorrow at bis death.

From this time Scipio became thoroughly aristocratia
in his views, and was thus brought into close intimacy
with Laelius, although, previously, he had with him

maintained a middle ground between the aristocracy
’ and the agitatore for reform.
